      ul
        li.
          #[strong Allowing gig workers to quickly connect]. Through integrating
          with Open Platforms, gig platforms can allow gig workers to quickly
          connect and import their experience from other platforms.
          This allows for a shorter entry curve if the gig worker's experience 
          and reputation is used to show the gig worker as reliable due to 
          having experience as a gig worker on other platforms, even if newly
          signed up.

        li.
          #[strong Supporting the gig economy]. Gig platforms have an interest
          in that gig workers can thrive and survive on providing gig work.
          Platforms integrating with Open Platforms support a sustainable 
          gig economy through both allowing gig workers to import and export
          their experience, earnings and reputation with other platforms and
          applications.

      h3 Platforms and Applications
      p.
        In Open Platforms, #[strong platforms] provide data for individual 
        #[strong gig workers] through integration with #[strong applications]. 
        In other words, platforms make data available for each authenticated 
        gig worker to be retrieved by an application.
      h3 Gig workers
      p.
        Gig work consists of income-earning activities outside of traditional,
        long-term employment.
      p.
        Gig work tends to be temporary or project-based, where gig workers are
        hired to complete a particular task or work for an agreed period of time.
      p.
        Gig workers perform work based on a contract other than a traditional
        employment contract. Gig workers do not receive benefits that employers
        are normally required to provide to employees. 
      p.
        To support a sustainable gig economy, Open Platforms provides the 
        standards and infrastructure for gig workers to use their experience 
        from one gig platform to another.
